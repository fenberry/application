<h1> This is Fen's application website. </h1>

<p> Lemme show you some cool things i can do while coding. HTML is simple, and I've been working on it since about 3rd grade. (I was in an advanced class and had to take coding, which turned out to be really fun!) </p>

<p> First, let me introduce myself. My name is Fen, and I really love Pokemon and animals. I'm very skilled with computers, and hope to be someone who works with computers and technology in the future. </p>

<p style="color:red">I can do things like this!!</p>
